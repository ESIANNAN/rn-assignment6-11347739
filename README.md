An app that accepts card component and changes theme of the app

The app serves a shopping app where users can add items, remove items and search items that are available. It also shows the prices and descriptions of the items available.
In designing the screens or pages of the app, I created the Home screen first. where I started adding all the icons on the navigation bar. I then created 2 view components where these 2 components had 4 images, descriptions and prices of each item. To make the items appear in 2 rows, i put the said 2 components in 1 component and set the flex direction to row. 
I increased and decreased margins to position the items very carefully. The add button was then added so that users can add items they have selected to cart. The cart icon helps users gto also view already selected items and decide to either to purchase it or to remove it from cart.
